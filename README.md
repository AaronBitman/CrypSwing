# CrypSwing
A cryptogram solver using Java and Swing classes

The current version of CrypSwing is 2.1. You can see a demo video of 2.0 at either of these URLs:

After 2.0, 2.1 has only 3 changes: the solving algorithm works a little harder, Pyrc has a
like-exclusion option (and a bug fix), and the plaintext spaces initially come up blank.

I also wrote another version of Cryp in Python. See my "Cryp" repository for that.
